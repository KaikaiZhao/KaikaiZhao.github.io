<p> When I was delving into the classical <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/~jwp2128/Papers/HoffmanBleiWangPaisley2013.pdf" target="_blank">Stochastic Variational Inference</a>(SVI) paper, I found SVI is built upon natural gradients which are based on the form of exponential family. In particular, exponential family significantly facilitates the derivations of the expectations of variational distributions.</p>

Most of the distributions we have seen are from exponential family, except the Gaussian mixture. In this blog, I will summarize what I have explored and learned about exponential family. Also, I will present some beautiful properties from exponential family.

### Definition
The exponential family of distributions over $$x$$, given parameters $$\eta$$, is defined to be the set of distributions of the form

\begin{equation}
    p(x|\eta)=h(x) \exp \\{\eta^{T}T(x) -A(\eta)\\}
\end{equation}

where:

* $$\eta$$ is a vector of natural parameters
* $$T(x)$$ is sufficent statistics
* $$A(\eta)$$ is log normalizer

Let me explain the log normalizer a little bit more by calculating the integral of the above density estimation function over $$x$$
\begin{equation}
    \int p(x|\eta)dx=\frac{\int h(x) \exp \\{\eta^{T}T(x) \\}dx}{\exp\\{ A(\eta)\\} }=1
    \label{eq:integral}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    A(\eta)=\log \left(\int h(x) \exp \\{\eta^{T}T(x) \\}dx\right)
    \label{eq:log-normalizer}
\end{equation}
From Eq. \eqref{eq:integral} and Eq. \eqref{eq:log-normalizer}, we can get why $$A(\eta)$$ is dubbed log normalizer.

### Beautiful properties

If we take the first derivative of the log normalizer, i.e. Eq. \eqref{eq:log-normalizer}, with respect to $$\eta$$, we have

$$
    \begin{aligned}
    \frac{\partial A(\eta)}{\partial \eta}
    &=\frac{\partial \log \left(\int h(x) \exp \{\eta^{T}T(x)\}dx\right) }{\partial \eta}\\
    &=\frac{\int h(x) \exp \{\eta^{T}T(x)\}T(x)dx }{\int h(x) \exp \{\eta^{T}T(x) \}dx}\\
    &\overset{\eqref{eq:integral}}{=}\frac{\int h(x)\exp\{\eta^{T}T(x)\}T(x)dx}{\exp\{A(\eta)\}}\\
    
    \end{aligned}\tag{4}
$$

&=\int h(x)\exp\{\eta^{T}T(x)-A(\eta)\}dx
