<p> When I was delving into the classical <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/~jwp2128/Papers/HoffmanBleiWangPaisley2013.pdf" target="_blank">Stochastic Variational Inference</a>(SVI) paper, I found SVI is built upon natural gradients which are based on the form of exponential family. In particular, exponential family significantly facilitates the derivations of the expectations of variational distributions.</p>

Most of the distributions we have seen are from exponential family, except the Gaussian mixture. In this blog, I will summarize what I have explored and learned about exponential family. Also, I will present some beautiful properties from exponential family.

### Definition
The exponential family of distributions over $$x$$, given parameters $$\eta$$, is defined to be the set of distributions of the form

\begin{equation}
    p(x|\eta)=h(x) \exp \\{\eta^{T}T(x) -A(\eta)\\}
\end{equation}

where:

* $$\eta$$ is a vector of natural parameters
* $$T(x)$$ is sufficent statistics
* $$A(\eta)$$ is log normalizer

Let me explain the log normalizer a little bit more by calculating the integral of the above density estimation function over $$x$$
\begin{equation}
    \int p(x|\eta)dx=\frac{\int h(x) \exp \\{T(x) \\}dx}{\exp\\{ A(\eta)\\} }=1 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    A(\eta)=\log \left(\int h(x) \exp \\{T(x) \\}dx\right)
\end{equation}


 * Mathematical equations of unbeatable quality.

 * Easy generation of all kind of indices, bibliography, cross references, etc.

 * allows you to focus on the text content, instead of its appearance. In theory, a text prepared according to the guidelines of a specific journal may be made to fit anotherâ€™s style by just using one external style file. In practice, sometimes one finds some incompatibilities, but in all cases it is orders of magnitude faster, cleaner and easier than manually changing all the formatting details in Word.
 
 * It is completely machine independent, Word is not
 
 * It is free, Word is not
 
 * Backward and forward compatible, Word is not
