Recent developments in the Web, Social Media, Sensors and Mobile devices have resulted in the explosion of data set
sizes. That has resulted in the emergence of Big Data. It has applications in industry ranging from retail, healthcare,
financial services, government, agriculture, customer service among others. Nowadays, business depends on
customersâ€™ data protection; however, due to the large size of data it has become very difficult to perform effective
analysis using the existing traditional techniques. Thus, the big data opportunities come with the challenge of security.
The flourishing of big data also hinges on fully understanding and managing newly arising security and privacy
challenges. This paper reviewed the recent research and development on the trending issues in security and privacy in
the field of Big Data. First, the characteristics and value of big data are presented. Then, topics and issues on security
