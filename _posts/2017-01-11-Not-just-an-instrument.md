I believe that how we play is largely informed by the state of our souls.
> * Are we generally at peace with life? 
* Are we feeling in constant conflict?
* Are we in rebellion against.....virtually everything?
* Constantly wound up.....or taking life as it comes? 
* Think the above doesn't impact how you play?
