Writing, whether you do it for work reports, your thesis, a paper you are working on, or just for fun.
In general it arrives that we ask ourselves if indeed we have been using the right  tool for the simple reason that the output does not really reflect what you wanted. 

It may seem cumbersome, at the beginning but once one overcomes the (steep) learning curve of LaTeX, the realization of its advantages means that there is no turning back:

 * Mathematical equations of unbeatable quality.

 * Easy generation of all kind of indices, bibliography, cross references, etc.

 * allows you to focus on the text content, instead of its appearance. In theory, a text prepared according to the guidelines of a specific journal may be made to fit anotherâ€™s style by just using one external style file. In practice, sometimes one finds some incompatibilities, but in all cases it is orders of magnitude faster, cleaner and easier than manually changing all the formatting details in Word.
